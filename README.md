# genetic algorithm gfx
2nd try of genetic algorithms!

This time there is a population of dots at the start, moving in random (total random, not gaussian or w. perlin noise. not yet!).
The generations are trying their best to reach from left to the right side of the canvas. If they reach their goal,
the algorithm exits(not yet).

To run it, open the index.html file in your browser!
